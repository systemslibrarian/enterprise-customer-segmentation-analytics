# 📊 Enterprise Customer Segmentation & Analytics

From raw data to actionable customer intelligence — powered by SQL & Python.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/Enterprise-Customer-Segmentation-Analytics/blob/main/Enterprise_Customer_Segmentation_Analytics.ipynb)

## 📌 Purpose
This notebook is designed to showcase **professional-grade SQL analytics** combined with **Python interactivity** for real-world business insights. It walks through data cleaning, advanced SQL techniques, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling — ending with an **interactive dashboard** and actionable recommendations.

## 📈 Key Business Questions
1. **Who are our customers?** — Clean data and create foundational segments based on spending.
2. **How do they behave?** — Analyze purchase frequency, product diversity, and identify VIPs.
3. **Who should we focus on next?** — Build a predictive segment for high-potential customers.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- **Advanced SQL**: CTEs, window functions, LAG/LEAD, multi-dimensional segmentation
- **Performance Tuning**: Using `EXPLAIN`
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Drill down into customer profiles using ipywidgets
- **Predictive Analytics**: Identify 'Potential VIPs'
- **Productionization Guidance**: Scheduling with Papermill, Cloud Scheduler, Airflow
